# Personal AI-Privacy Capsule (PAC)

## Project Summary

Personal AI-Privacy Capsule (PAC) is a comprehensive privacy-focused application designed to address the growing risks of data exposure in AI interactions. By detecting, sanitizing, and reinserting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entirely on-device, PAC ensures that sensitive information never leaves the userâ€™s control. This solution empowers individuals and organizations to harness the power of AI while remaining compliant with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.

## Core Features & Functionality

- Text Privacy Protection: Regex PII detection, sanitization, AI proxy, reinsertion.
- Image Privacy Protection: Face detection, blurring, pixelation, optional AI vision.
- Audit & Compliance: Logging, CSV export, signed receipts, TTL vault.
- Security Features: HMAC authentication, key versioning, rate limiting, CORS.
- User Interface: React Native app, dark theme, configurable settings, real-time feedback.


## Key Benefits

- Zero Trust Architecture: No external service sees raw PII.
- User Control: Full ownership of privacy decisions.
- Deterministic Processing: Predictable privacy enforcement.
- Compliance Ready: Built-in audit trails and deletion verification.
- Cross-Platform: Works on iOS and Android.
- Extensible: Modular design supports future PII types.

## Relevant Problem Statement

Theme: (7) Privacy Meets AI: Building a Safer Digital Future

In today's AI-driven world, users face significant privacy risks when interacting with cloud-based AI services. Sensitive personal data, including emails, phone numbers, and images, are often transmitted to third-party servers without sufficient safeguards, exposing users to identity theft, data leakage, and regulatory non-compliance.
